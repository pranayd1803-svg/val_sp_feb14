      <h1>For my VALENTINE! 💓</h1>
      <h3>I hope you liked this mini activity you've been doing this week. If it made you smile from ear to ear or just giggle even a bit, then the task is considered successful.</h3>
      <h3></h3>
      <h3>I want you to keep smiling like you are this whole time, as I've mentioned your smile is contagious and it makes me smile too. I want you to keep your optimistic energy going ahead cuz hope is the best thing in this world and you deserve nothing less than that. I know you will achieve what you want to cuz no matter how procrastinative you are, i noticed that you get things done. I hope you become home for ppl that you love and care about. I will be by your side in every decision that you take - not in a i'll keep burden of choice on you kind of way but more like I will back you up no matter what happens. You will get ahead of your fears, it might take time but I know you will. Know that you are loved and you deserve every bit of love you get. A lot of words are just flowing in a stream in my brain but we'll save it for some other day. Happy Valentines day!</h3>
      <p>I want you to be my witness to the shit I do. Will you continue with that full-time role? I can assure you the work timings won't be hectic at all</p>
